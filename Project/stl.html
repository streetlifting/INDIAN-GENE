        <h2>Rules of Powerlifting</h2>
        <p>
          Streetlifting competitions are conducted under strict rules. Each lift
          has specific requirements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Squat:</strong> The lifter must lower their hips below knee
            level.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pull Ups:</strong> a valid pull-up starts from a dead hang (elbows locked), requires the chin to pass the bar without kipping, and ends with full arm extension.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dips:</strong> a valid dip starts with locked-out arms, requires lowering until the shoulders go below the elbows, and ends with full arm extension without swinging.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>muscle-ups:</strong>a valid muscle-up starts from a dead hang, requires a strict pull-up (chin over bar), a smooth transition over the bar, and ends with full arm extension in the dip position without kipping.
